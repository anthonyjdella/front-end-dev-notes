# Internet

    * The internet is a distributed (not central) system of interconnected computer networks that use TCP/IP (communication protocols/set of rules) to link devices. The Internet is the network that makes computers communicate together. Internet is the infrastructure, Web is the service (Internet is parent).

    * Data sent over the Internet are in bits (0s and 1s) as binary code. The maximum amount of bits sent due to a device's capacity is called bandwidth. Latency is how fast a data packet can travel from point A to point B.

    * My network -> router -> modem -> ISP -> destination ISP -> destination modem -> destination router -> destination network
    
    * A router, routes data to a specific location, rather than multiple computers accessing eachother at the same time. Instead of having one computer send and receive many requests, that request is sent to a router to handle, which then routes it to the destination.

    * A modem, allows your network to connect to other networks. This is done over telephone wires/infrastructure.

    * An ISP is linked to other ISPs and helps route our destination.

    * IP address is a unique identifier of an address (web site or computer).

    * Domain name is the alias of an IP address that makes it human readable (e.g google.com)

    * DNS is like an address book that will look up the domain name with the corresponding IP address.

# Web

    * Clients (request) and servers (response) are what make up the Web.

    * Clients are the device and servers are the computer that store the webpages.

    * Browser -> DNS -> IP address -> HTTP request -> HTTP response 

    * HTTP is a protocol that defines how clients and servers speak to eachother (methods like GET, POST).
